# D2L - Notes on Deep Learning

This repository contains quick notes and draft implementations based on my study of [Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai)](https://d2l.ai/). While the content here may seem fast-paced or rough at first glance, the underlying goal is to write **well-structured, object-oriented (OOP)** code that can be reused and easily revisited in the future.

## Purpose

- Serve as a **personal reference** for concepts from D2L.ai.
- Practice writing **clean, modular, and reusable** code using OOP principles.
- Provide a base for extending or adapting code for future chapters.

## Notes

- Some files may look incomplete or "draft-like" â€” that's intentional for speed.
- I aim to refactor where needed to maintain clarity and reusability.
- This is a learning-first repository, so code may evolve as my understanding grows.

Feel free to use or adapt the code and notes here as a reference, but keep in mind that it's a **work in progress**.
