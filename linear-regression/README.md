# Linear Regression

This folder contains an implementation of **Linear Regression** using **mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function. The model is trained on a dataset of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** stock **closing prices** over a specific time interval.

## Overview

- Implements linear regression from scratch, without high-level ML frameworks.
- Uses mini-batch SGD for training efficiency.
- Applies MSE as the loss function to evaluate performance.
- The dataset consists of historical closing prices of the AAPL stock.

## Notes

- This is part of a broader set of notes and code based on the book [Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai)](https://d2l.ai/).
- While developed quickly as part of a learning workflow, the code is written with reusability and clarity in mind, using object-oriented practices where appropriate.
